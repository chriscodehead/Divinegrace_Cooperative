                            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                            At <?php print $siteName;?>, we are committed to preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. This policy outlines our procedures to detect, prevent, and report money laundering activities.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Definition of Money Laundering:</h3>
                            Money laundering is the process of disguising the proceeds of illegal activity as legitimate funds. It involves converting the proceeds of illegal activity into funds or assets that appear to have a legitimate origin.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Risk Assessment:</h3>
                            We conduct regular risk assessments to identify and assess the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. This helps us to determine the measures we need to take to prevent money laundering and to ensure the integrity of our services.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Client Due Diligence:</h3>
                            We perform client due diligence measures to verify the identity of our clients and to assess the risk of money laundering. This includes verifying the client's identity through government-issued identification, verifying the client's source of funds, and monitoring the client's transactions for unusual or suspicious activity.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Internal Controls:</h3>
                            We have established internal controls to detect and prevent money laundering. These controls include monitoring transactions for unusual or suspicious activity, reporting suspicious activity to the relevant authorities, and implementing a training program for employees to increase their awareness of money laundering and to educate them on the importance of preventing it.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Record Keeping:</h3>
                            We keep records of all transactions and client information for a minimum of five years. This helps us to comply with regulatory requirements and to detect and prevent money laundering.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Reporting:</h3>
                            We report any suspicious activity to the relevant authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
                            </p><p>

                            <h3>Continuous Improvement:</h3>
                            We regularly review and update our Anti-Money Laundering Policy to ensure that it is effective and in line with the latest regulations and best practices.
                            </p><p>
